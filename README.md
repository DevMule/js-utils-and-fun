This is a place where i contain my different js stuff
# UTILS
- **math** - my implementation of some math

    [📁 go to **math**](https://github.com/DevMule/js-utils-and-fun/tree/master/math/)

- **MYDOM** - JS lib, dom controller and staff made on it such as charts, tabs, etc... 

    [📁 go to **MYDOM**](https://github.com/DevMule/js-utils-and-fun/tree/master/MYDOM/)

# FUN
### Conway's Game Of Life
- Field in "Game Of Life" is cycled. That means if, for example, size of field is 100 x 100, 
then cell in coordinate (0, 0) is neighbour to cell in coordinate (0, 99).

    [> run **Game Of Life**](https://devmule.github.io/js-utils-and-fun/conways-game-of-life/) 

### Langton's ant
- Field in "Langton's ant" is infinite. Field is made with "tiles". "Tile" is a piece of 2D space,
which contains values of cell in certain coordinates. If cell of certain tile were modified, 
then tile is saving in memory as 2-dimensional array. It allows to make an infinite field, and use 
as little memory as possible.

    [> run **Langton's ant**](https://devmule.github.io/js-utils-and-fun/langtons-ant/)

### transformation matrix demo
- My attempt to create an interactive object in 3d space. 
All code of demo is contained in html file, which is not typical to me.

    [> run **transformation matrix demo**](https://devmule.github.io/js-utils-and-fun/transformation-matrix/)
    
### Ann adventure
- Artificial neural network project based on **MYDOM** and **math**
